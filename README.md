# Homelab

My attempt to create a homelab. This repo will contain various configuration files for my homelab.


## Ansible 

First install the ansible in the host machine only. 

Then create a ssh key on the host machine and copy it to the remote machines / nodes / worker nodes. 

Remember to add ssh key in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and give it proper permissions.
